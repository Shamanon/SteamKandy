Midi Controller based on Arduino Teensy with mapping files for Mixxx

The goal of this controller is to expand use of Mixxx's 4 sample decks and includes Low and High dropout buttons for decks A and B.

Mixxx folder contains midi mappings that need to be copied into Mixxx's "controllers" folder.
Arduino folder contains sketchbook files.
Graphics folder contains faceplate templates and images of finished controller.

In future versions I would like to see more output to LCD screen.

The code here can be easily expanded and/or altered to meet your custom controller needs.
